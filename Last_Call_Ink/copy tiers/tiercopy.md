### Foundation Features

#### 01 HIGH-CONVERTING WEBSITE
We build a fresh, custom website from the ground up that is AEO/SEO/GEO optimized. This ensures you show up as a Top Recommendation when people search 'Best Bar Near Me' or ask AI where to go tonight. We don't overhaul old junk; we build the engine right the first time[42, 46, 48].

#### 02 2-HOUR CONTENT STUDIO
**YOUR CONTENT ISN'T CUTTING IT!** A professional on-site shoot delivering 50 edited photos (Drinks, Venue, Staff, and Bartender Action Shots) + 5 high-impact short-form videos. We make your cocktails look like $15 instead of $6. Use these everywhere—website, Google, socials. The ROI on looking premium is priceless[50, 51].

#### 03 DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE
We sync your hours, menu, and info across Google, Yelp, Apple Maps, and 20+ local directories. No more 'I showed up and you were closed' 1-star reviews. A clean, verified presence across the web translates to trust and more asses in seats[52, 53, 54].

#### 04 THE EQUITY VAULT
We design and host a custom, on-brand landing page and database to capture guest data. You own your customers' information—not Yelp, not Instagram. This turns one-time visitors into a permanent digital asset we can activate on demand[55, 69].

#### 05 CUSTOM ASSET DESIGN
We provide high-res, on-brand QR designs for your stickers, signage, and table tents. These are the physical hooks that capture guest data automatically while your staff focuses on service[55].

#### 06 AUTOMATED MISSED CALL TEXT-BACK
The ultimate safety net. If you're too slammed to answer, the system immediately texts the guest back to book a table or check tonight's specials. Stop losing revenue to the noise[82].
